Gridwise is a JavaScript library that provides high-performance WebGPU compute primitives. Our goal is to deliver best-in-class performance while minimizing the code complexity for developers.

## Key Features

- **WebGPU Compute Primitives**: Scan, reduce, sort, and other fundamental parallel operations
- **High Performance**: Optimized implementations using modern GPU architectures
- **Easy to Use**: Simple JavaScript API that handles low-level WebGPU details
- **Cross-Platform**: Works across different WebGPU-capable devices and browsers

## Getting Started

Gridwise primitives are designed to be instantiated and executed with minimal setup. The library handles WebGPU object creation, memory management, and shader compilation automatically.
